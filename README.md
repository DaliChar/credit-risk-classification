**Credit-risk-classification**

In this Challenge, We’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. We’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

**Instructions**

- The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

- Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

- Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

- Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data

- Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
